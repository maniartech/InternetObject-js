## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability in Internet Object, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email us privately at: `security@maniartech.com`

### What to Include
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Next scheduled release

## Security Practices

### Development Security
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of outputs

### Infrastructure Security
- **GitHub Security**: Two-factor authentication required
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets in code or commits
- **Branch Protection**: Protected master/main branch

## Dependency Management

### Regular Audits
We perform regular security audits of our dependencies:

```bash
# Weekly security check
yarn security:audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
yarn security:audit-fix

# Check for outdated packages
yarn deps:check
```

### Dependency Policies
1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary packages
2. **Trusted Sources**: Prefer well-maintained, popular packages
3. **Version Pinning**: Lock critical dependencies to specific versions
4. **Regular Updates**: Weekly dependency review and updates
5. **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities

### Supported Versions
We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | End of Life |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes    | TBD         |
| 0.9.x   | ❌ No     | 2024-01-01  |
| < 0.9   | ❌ No     | 2023-01-01  |

## Automated Security

## Common Vulnerabilities

### What We Protect Against
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Regular scanning and updates
2. **Code Injection**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **Information Disclosure**: Careful error handling
4. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Dependency integrity checks
5. **Denial of Service**: Resource limits and validation

### Best Practices for Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Validate Inputs**: Don't trust user input
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose internal details
4. **Security Headers**: Use appropriate security headers
5. **Regular Audits**: Scan your own dependencies

## Incident Response

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Assess the severity and impact
   - Contain the issue if possible
   - Document everything

2. **Communication**:
   - Notify the security team
   - Prepare public disclosure (if needed)
   - Coordinate with affected users

3. **Resolution**:
   - Develop and test fix
   - Release emergency patch
