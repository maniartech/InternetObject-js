# Feature: Core Package Improvements

## Overview

Review and enhance the `core` package for maintainability, clarity, performance, and testability, following best practices and minimalism principles.

## Requirements

1. Refactor IOObject & IOCollection for clarity and performance
   - **Reasoning:** Central data structures should be efficient, clear, and easy to use/test.

   - **Todo List:**

     - [ ] Use native JS Map/Array internally where possible
     - [ ] Ensure all mutating methods return `this` for chaining
     - [ ] Add iterator and serialization methods
     - [ ] Document all public methods
     - [ ] Add/expand unit tests for all methods

   - **Test Criteria:**

     - [ ] All collection/object methods work as expected and are covered by tests

   - **Coding Standards & Best Practices:**

     - Use native JS structures
     - Document APIs
     - Avoid unnecessary abstraction

   - **Minimalism & Guidelines:**

     - Keep implementation simple, avoid over-engineering

2. Audit and improve Decimal arithmetic and error handling

   - **Reasoning:** High-precision arithmetic must be robust and well-tested

   - **Todo List:**

     - [ ] Audit for edge cases (overflow, underflow, rounding)
     - [ ] Add/expand unit tests for all arithmetic operations
     - [ ] Document rounding, precision, and error handling
     - [ ] Consider using a well-maintained external library if possible

   - **Test Criteria:**

     - [ ] Decimal operations are correct and robust

   - **Coding Standards & Best Practices:**

     - Document APIs
     - Add robust error handling

   - **Minimalism & Guidelines:**

     - Only implement necessary features

3. Refactor and document Definitions, Header, Document, Section, SectionCollection

   - **Reasoning:** Ensure clear separation of concerns and robust schema/definition logic

   - **Todo List:**

     - [ ] Refactor for clarity and SRP
     - [ ] Document merging and serialization logic
     - [ ] Add input validation and error handling
     - [ ] Add/expand unit tests for all public methods

   - **Test Criteria:**

     - [ ] All logic is covered by tests

   - **Coding Standards & Best Practices:**

     - Follow SRP
     - Document APIs

   - **Minimalism & Guidelines:**

     - Avoid unnecessary abstraction

4. General Coding Standards

   - **Reasoning:** Consistency and clarity improve maintainability

   - **Todo List:**

     - [ ] Audit for naming, comments, and dead code
     - [ ] Remove unused files (e.g., `decimal.bak.ts`)
     - [ ] Add/expand unit tests for all files

   - **Test Criteria:**

     - [ ] All files are documented and tested

   - **Coding Standards & Best Practices:**

     - Use consistent naming conventions
     - Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs

   - **Minimalism & Guidelines:**

     - Only keep necessary code

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. Audit and refactor IOObject/IOCollection for clarity and performance
2. Review Decimal for correctness, edge cases, and documentation
3. Refactor and document Definitions, Header, Document, Section, SectionCollection for SRP and clarity
4. Add/expand unit tests for all classes and methods
5. Remove dead code and ensure consistent coding standards

## Todo List

- [ ] Refactor IOObject/IOCollection internals and document APIs
- [ ] Audit and test Decimal arithmetic and error handling
- [ ] Refactor/document Definitions, Header, Document, Section, SectionCollection
- [ ] Add/expand unit tests for all classes/methods
- [ ] Remove dead code and ensure consistent standards

## Test Criteria

- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] All classes/methods are covered by unit tests
- [ ] No dead code or unused files
- [ ] Consistent naming and coding standards

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

- Use native JS structures where possible
- Document all public APIs
- Follow SRP, KISS, YAGNI
- Add robust error handling and input validation
- Write clear, maintainable, and testable code

## Minimalism & Over-Engineering Check

- Solution is simple and maintainable: Yes
- No unnecessary abstractions: Yes
