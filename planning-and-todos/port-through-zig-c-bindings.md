# Internet Object Porting Roadmap: Zig "C Binding" Approach

One of the most efficient ways to port the Internet Object specification to multiple languages is to create a core implementation in Zig, which can then be exposed as a C ABI. This allows for easy Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bindings in many languages, leveraging Zig's safety and performance.

## Phase 1: Reference & Design

* [ ] **Lock the Reference Implementation**

  * Finalize and freeze JS/TS API, fixtures, and all behavioral contracts.
  * Extract language-agnostic test suites (input/output, schemas, streaming, edge cases).

* [ ] **Design the Zig Library API (C ABI)**

  * Write all core logic in Zig: parsing, serialization, validation, streaming.
  * Define exported functions as `export fn ... callconv(.C)`—only use C-compatible types.
  * Specify structs, enums, and memory management patterns (allocation, freeing).
  * Add doc comments and usage examples for both Zig and C consumers.

## Phase 2: Build & Test the Zig C Library

* [ ] **Implement Core Features in Zig**

  * Implement parsing, serialization, validation, and (optionally) streaming/chunked operations.
  * Use Zig’s safety features but always export a clean C ABI.

* [ ] **Generate C Headers & Artifacts**

  * Use `zig build-lib` to output `.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`, `.a`, and `.h` header files.
  * Ensure ABI stability and platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, x64, etc.).

* [ ] **Testing**

  * Create a Zig-native test suite.
  * Build test runners in C using the generated `.h` and shared libraries.
  * Ensure all reference fixtures are passed.

## Phase 3: FFI Bindings for Other Languages

* [ ] **Create and Document FFI Bindings For:**

  * **Python** (`ctypes`, `cffi`)
  * **PHP** (PHP extension)
  * **Ruby** (Ruby FFI)
  * **Zig** (direct import)
  * **Lua** (LuaJIT FFI or C module)
  * **Nim** (Nim FFI)
  * **Haskell** (Foreign import)
  * **D** (D FFI)
  * ...any language with C FFI

* [ ] **Provide Usage Examples and “Getting Started” Guides**

  * For each supported language, show basic usage: parse, serialize, validate, stream.
  * Document build/setup process (e.g., how to load `.so`, `.dll` on each OS).

* [ ] **Test All Bindings**

  * Reuse fixtures to test each binding’s correctness and compatibility.

## Phase 4: Community Wrappers & Contributions

* [ ] **Encourage and List Community Wrappers**

  * Maintain a section in your docs/repo listing language bindings and their maintainers.
  * Mark bindings as “official” or “community-supported” as appropriate.
  * Provide guidelines and CI for keeping bindings in sync with the Zig core.

## Phase 5: Maintenance and Upgrades

* [ ] **Automate Build & Release**

  * Use Zig’s cross-compilation features to ship prebuilt binaries for major platforms.
  * Automate header and artifact generation as part of the release process.

* [ ] **Keep Bindings and Test Suites in Sync**

  * All new features and fixes in Zig core are tested in each binding via the shared fixtures.

## Example Compatibility Table

| Feature    | Zig Core | Python | PHP | Ruby | Zig | Lua | Nim | Haskell | D  |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | -- |
| Parse      | ✅        | ✅      | ✅   | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅       | ✅  |
| Serialize  | ✅        | ✅      | ✅   | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅       | ✅  |
| Validation | ✅        | ✅      | ✅   | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅       | ✅  |
| Streaming  | 🚧       | ⬜️     | ⬜️  | ⬜️   | ⬜️  | ⬜️  | ⬜️  | ⬜️      | ⬜️ |

## Best Practices

* **Export only C-compatible APIs:** Use basic types, opaque pointers, and explicit allocation/freeing.
* **Document clearly:** Provide `.h` headers and guides for every FFI consumer.
* **Automate builds:** Use Zig to cross-compile and generate prebuilt binaries/headers for all platforms.
* **Maintain strict test parity:** All bindings should pass the same fixtures and behavior tests.
* **Engage the community:** List and support community-contributed bindings.

## Directory Structure Example

```
internet-object/
  core-zig/
    src/
    build.zig
    include/
      internetobject.h
    test/
    bindings/
      python/
      php/
      ruby/
      lua/
      nim/
      haskell/
      d/
    README.md
  fixtures/
  js/
  docs/
  ...
```

**Summary:**

* Zig = one core, fast, safe codebase
* Exposes stable C ABI for all major languages
* Easy cross-platform, easy for community to add more wrappers
